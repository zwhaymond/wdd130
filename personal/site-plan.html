      <h3>Remnant 2</h3>
      <p>
        Remnant 2 is a third-person shooter action role-playing video game developed by Gunfire Games and published by Gearbox Publishing. A sequel to Remnant: From the Ashes, the game was released for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S on July 25, 2023.
        Main page: https://www.remnantgame.com/en/

        Description:
        In Remnant 2, you fight for survival as you fight swarms of monsters that vary depending on where you are, Boss of all shapes and forms, and infinite replay-ability. From start to finish, you’ll be discovering new things even if you have hundreds of hours of play time, be it new weapons, items, dungeons, or even classes, there’s so much to do! Adding a layer of difficulty will allow you to challenge your skills as you make you character the ultimate killing machine. And to add to boot, it’s now cross playable with friends!
        Remnant: From the ashes
        Coming after the Sequel Remnant: From the ashes, the story uses many character the come from that game and much of its story too. The Lore is extensive and there are many secrets to discover from Reading book, doing puzzles, and talking to NPC. If you wish to understand more about the lore of Remnant 2, I recommend that you play Remnant: From the ashes (Being a great game itself) and then play Remnant 2.

      <h3>Helldiver 2</h3>
      <p>
        You’ve probably seen tons of videos on every platform now and how it’s depicted as a funny game… which it is! With the threat to Managed Democracy you have been called to fight as a hero of the war efforts, A Helldiver! Fighting hordes of enemies without end, you fight to liberate the system of the enemy’s control and to spread liberty and Managed Democracy. It’s a great way to spend time with friends and to have a good laugh.
        Helldivers 1 is a different game so it doesn’t have much to relate but It’s also know to be a great game, if you wish to learn a little bit more about it here’s a link to the steam page:
        https://store.steampowered.com/app/394510/HELLDIVERS_Dive_Harder_Edition/
        Description:
        The environment of Helldivers 2 is a calm place where you can play without worrying about if you’ll do well or not because everyone is having a good time trying not to die too. As you play the game, gather resources, and liberate planets you’ll be rewarded with more powerful weapons, attacks, and armor. It’ll allow you to get more out of it as you go forward into the swarms.

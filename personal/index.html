            <p> This site was made to help you find a game or two that you will want to play! In place of having to go and find all the information yourself about a Game, here we have gathered the information about several games so you can find out all the different things you want to know here! The video games that we have recommended are already available and popular but maybe have slid under your radar or you’ve had your doubts about these games but here we’ll prove that you should play and enjoy them.</p>

            <h2>Two Games </h2>

            <p> The Games that we have recommended are: First: Remnant 2, a post-apocalyptic soul-like game, and sequel to Remnant from the ashes. Second: Helldivers 2, A third person shooter where you fight for the protection of Super Earth and its managed Democracy. Both games are hits and are still receiving changes from their developers so there’s possible future content to be played as you enjoy the game now. As you read more about these games, we will provide links for reviews, prices, and descriptions so you can get a basic idea of how these games are and get a general understanding of why you showed buy it. You’ll also be able to see the style of the game from several images we will provide and get a feel for how it will look as you play it. </p>
